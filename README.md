# Week 1
## Day 1:Introduction & Go Syntax
### Theory
Theory: Go data types, variables, constants, and basic syntax.
Coding: Write simple programs like a calculator or string manipulator.

### Tasks

**1. Basic Program:**

Write a Go program that takes two numbers as input, performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and then prints the results.

**2. String Manipulation:**

Create a program that takes a string as input, converts it to uppercase, and prints the number of characters in the string.

**3. Constants and Variables:**

Define two constants, PI and E, for the mathematical constants Pi (3.14) and Euler's number (2.71). Then write a program that calculates the circumference of a circle using the radius input by the user and prints both the circumference and the exponential of the radius.

Formula:
```
Circumference = 2 * PI * radius
Exponential = E^radius (you can use math.Pow to calculate the power)
```

**4. Data Types Practice:**

Write a Go program that declares variables of different types (int, float64, string, bool) and prints them along with their types.

**5. Type Conversion:**

Write a program that converts a float64 value to an int and prints both the original and the converted values.

**6. Challenge:**

Create a program that prompts the user for their age, then calculates and prints how many days old they are (assuming 365 days per year).

```
Enter your age: 25
You are approximately 9125 days old.
```
